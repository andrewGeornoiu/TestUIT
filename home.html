            <h4 id="summary">US President Joe Biden has agreed "in principle" to hold a summit with <br /> 
                Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss the crisis over Ukraine. </h4>

            <p>The talks proposed by France will only take place if Russia does not invade its <br /> neighbour, the White House said.</p>
            
            <p>The meeting could offer a possible diplomatic solution to one of the worst <br /> security crises in Europe in decades.</p>
            
            <p>US officials say intelligence suggests Russia is ready to launch a military<br />  operation, which Moscow denies.</p>
            
            <p>The proposal was announced by the French presidency after two phone calls <br /> between President Emmanuel Macron and Mr Putin, which went on for almost <br /> three hours in total.</p>
            
            <p>The second exchange happened in the early hours of Monday Moscow time, <br /> and followed a 15-minute conversation Mr Macron had with Mr Biden.</p>
            
            <p>Mr Macron's office said details of the possible summit would be discussed <br /> during a meeting between US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Russian <br /> Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Thursday.</p>
            
            <p>In a statement that confirmed the proposal, the White House also said Russia <br /> appeared to be "continuing preparations for a full-scale assault on Ukraine<br />  very soon", and that the US was ready to impose "swift and severe<br />  consequences" should it happen.</p>
            
            <p>Russia has massed more than 150,000 troops close to Ukraine's borders,<br />  according to US estimates.</p>
            
            <p>US company Maxar said new satellite imagery showed multiple new field <br /> deployments of armoured equipment and troops from Russian garrisons near<br />  the border with Ukraine, indicating increased military readiness.</p>

            <h4>The Beijing Winter Olympics came to a close on Sunday in a touching <br />ceremony.</h4>

            <p>Almost 3,000 athletes competed in 109 events across 15 disciplines <br />during the past two weeks.</p>
            
            <p>International Olympic Committee president Thomas Bach called for<br /> political leaders "around the world" to be inspired by the athletes'<br /> "example of solidarity and peace".</p>
            
            <p>"This unifying power of the Olympic Games is stronger than the forces<br /> that want to divide us," he said.</p>
            
            <p>Bach said the athletes had "given peace a chance," with his comments<br /> coming amid rising tensions between Russia and Ukraine.</p>
            
            <p>"Each and every one of you strived to achieve your personal best. We <br />were deeply touched how you were wishing and cheering for your <br />competitors to achieve their best as well," he said.</p>
            
            <p>"You not only respected each other: you embraced each other, even if<br /> your countries are divided by conflict."</p>
            
            <ul type="square">
                <li> <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/live/winter-olympics/57276842"> Rewatch closing ceremony & action from Beijing</a></li>
                <li> <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/winter-olympics/60450423">GB thrash Japan to win women's curling gold</a></li>

            </ul>
            
           
            <p>Bach also encouraged countries to continue vaccinating against Covid-19<br />, saying: "If we want to finally overcome this pandemic, we must<br /> be faster.</p>
            
            <p>"We must aim higher, we must be stronger, we must stand together. <br />Vaccination means caring for each other.</p>
            
            <p>"In this Olympic spirit of solidarity, we call on the international <br />community: give equal access to vaccines for everybody around the<br /> world."</p>
            
            <p>Great Britain leave Beijing with two medals - gold in the women's<br /> curling and silver in the men's event.</p>
            
            <p>Curling skip Bruce Mouat, who led the men's rink, was the flagbearer<br /> for Team GB at the closing ceremony.</p>
            
            <p>The Olympic flame was extinguished, with the next Games taking place <br />in Milan-Cortina in Italy in 2026. The Winter Paralympics begins in <br />Beijing on 4 March.</p>
